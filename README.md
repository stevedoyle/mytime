# mytime

A utility for extracting and summarizing time tracking information from daily
notes.

Time tracking information is organized into a hierarchical format which allows
for the collection of different categories of time information. This is useful
because it allows the collection of time spent on individual projects and also
the collection of time spent collaborating or doing deep work.

Time entries are strings of the format: `Time.Category.Name: hours` where
category is one of the following:

- Proj: Project time.
- Area: A more general category type. Useful for grouping projects into themes.
- Focus: Collaboration or Deep Work time.
- Prof: The [four types of professional time](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-4-types-of-professional-time?ref=mattrutherford.co.uk), Management, Creation, Consumption, Ideation.

The time information is entered in hours with decimal fractions supported, e.g. `10.5`.

The `Name` can be any string. It is sometimes useful to make this an extension
of the hierarchical structure, e.g. "Collab.Meeting". It will be treated as a
single string during processing.

`mytime` uses some conventions for the daily notes files that contain the time
tracking information:

- Markdown file format, extension `.md`
- Filename is the date of the daily note in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

`mytime` provides several options for specifying a time period. Only the daily
note files that lie within the specified time period will be included in the
analysis. If no time period is specified, today's time tracking info will be
analysed.

## Examples

Time information format within the daily note files:

```
Time.Proj.Example1: 3.5
Time.Proj.Exmaple2: 2

Time.Area.Theme1: 2.5
Time.Area.Managing: 1.5
Time.Area.Overhead: 4

Time.Focus.Collab.Meeting: 3
Time.Focus.Collab.Other: 2
Time.Focus.Deep: 5

Time.Prof.Management: 3
Time.Prof.Creation: 2
Time.Prof.Consumption: 1.5
Time.Prof.Ideation: 0
```

Getting the summary of *Focus* time from the example files in the examples directory:
```
mytime --path=./examples --from 2023-10-16 --to 2023-10-20 --category=Focus
```

Output:
```text
| Name           |   Hours |     % |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| Collab.Meeting |     9.0 | 50.00 |
| Deep           |     6.5 | 36.11 |
| Collab.Other   |     2.5 | 13.89 |
```
