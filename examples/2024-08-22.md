## Notes

Production metrics continue to look great after yesterday's WebApp deployment. Client was impressed with mobile app demo!

**Production Status:**
- All systems stable for 24+ hours
- Performance metrics holding steady
- User satisfaction scores improved

**Mobile App Feedback:**
- Client loved the authentication flow
- Requested minor UI adjustments for accessibility
- Want to proceed with production deployment next week

**Technical Debt:**
- Need to refactor API error handling
- Database queries could use further optimization
- Mobile app needs more comprehensive testing

Planning to focus on mobile app refinements tomorrow before the production push.

## Tomorrow

- Implement accessibility improvements for mobile app
- Complete API error handling refactor
- Schedule mobile app production deployment
